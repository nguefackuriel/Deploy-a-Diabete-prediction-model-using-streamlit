# Deploy-a-Diabete-prediction-model-using-streamlit

In this project, we will design a machine learning algorithm based on Gaussian Discriminant Analysis from scratch.

We will use the Diabete dataset containing 8 features: 

* Pregnancies: The number of pregnancies
* Glucose: The level of glucose
* BloodPressure: The value of the blood pressure
* SkinThickness: The SkinThickness value
* Insulin: The value of the Insulin
* BMI: The value of the Body Mass Indice
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: The DiabetesPedigreeFunction
* Age: The age of the patient


After building our model, we will save it using pickle and deploy it using streamlit.

The model accuracy is around 77%. You can try other models 

You will find everything you need to reproduce the project in this folder.
